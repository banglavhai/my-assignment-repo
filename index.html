            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="contact">I choked on a French fry. I couldn’t breathe in or out, even when coughing. I had tears
                running down my
                face,
                and when the adrenaline kicked in, it was terribly painful - a spiderweb of sharp pricks all over my
                chest.
                In my panic, I didn’t even think of 911 or Heimlich. When the French fry finally went down, my whole
                body
                ached, especially my arms. Thirty minutes later, my chest and arms still ache.</p>
